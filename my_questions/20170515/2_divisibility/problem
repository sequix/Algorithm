Description

As we know, the fzu AekdyCoin is famous of math, especially in the field 
of number theory. So, many people call him "the descendant of Chen Jingrun", 
which brings him a good reputation. 

AekdyCoin also plays an important role in the ACM_DIY group, many people 
always ask him questions about number theory. One day, all members urged him to 
conduct a lesson in the group. The rookie daizhenyang is extremely weak at math, 
so he is delighted. 

However, when AekdyCoin tells us "As we know, some numbers have 
interesting property. For example, any even number has the property that could be 
divided by 2. ", daizhenyang got confused, for he don't have the concept of 
divisibility. 

He asks other people for help, first, he randomly writes some 
positive integer numbers, then you have to pick some numbers from the 
group, the only constraint is that if you choose number a,
you can't choose a number divides a or a number divided by a.
(to illustrate the concept of divisibility),
and you have to choose as many numbers as you can. 
Poor daizhenyang does well in neither math nor programming.
The responsibility comes to you!

Input

An integer t(t<=20), indicating the number of test cases, 
For every case, first a number n indicating daizhenyang has written n 
numbers(n<=200), then n numbers, all in the range of (1...2^63-1). 
 
Output

The most number you can choose. 

Sample Input

1
3
1 2 3 

Sample Output

2

Hint:

If we choose 2 and 3, one is not divisible by the other, which is the most 
number you can choose.
