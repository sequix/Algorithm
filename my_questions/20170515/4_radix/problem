Description

Ten radix representation is natural to humans for practical reasons.
But it's not true for everyone. Now those who is anti-ten-radix are
asking you solve a problem:

Given a number in N radix, decide whether it is multiple of N-1.

Input

There are multiple test cases.
For every case, the first line gives N, M (1 <= N,M <= 1e3),
the fallowing are M positive integers within 32-bit two's
complement range, indicating the number in N radix
from the lowest valid digit to the highest one.

Output

Output 1 if the number is a multiple of N-1, otherwise, 0.

Sample Input

7 3
4 6 1
7 3
5 6 1
13 2
12 12

Sample Output

0
1
1

Hint

In first case,
"164" in 7 radix == "95" in 10 radix, and 95 is not a multiple of 6.
In second case,
"164" in 7 radix == "96" in 10 radix, and 96 is a multiple of 6.
